## From Zero to Jupyter at Lightning Speed

This repository contains the slides (in PowerPoint and PDF format)
and shell script from a lightning talk at PyData London 2017.

Its aim was to show how simple it is to get started with Python
and Jupyter using the `miniconda` package from Continuum Analytics.

If you run the shell script, note that the installer asks you
where to put the miniconda installation. Your answer MUST agree
with the location used later in the script (as released this is
_/tmp/m3_, but any accessible filestore location should work).

Pull requests welcome, or feel free to raise issues.
